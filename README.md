I will work through this headache. It has occurred to me that my health is a main determinant to whether I get much done or not. If I feel like crap, I don't work well, or I don't work at all.

Robotics programming, here I come! I will have robot friends by the time I die! I will be proud to talk about who I am and what I do on a daily basis :)
